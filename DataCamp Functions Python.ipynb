    "You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!\n"

    "Free\n",
    "The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. You'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.\n",

    "Decorators are an extremely powerful concept in Python. They allow you to modify the behavior of a function without changing the code of the function itself. This chapter will lay the foundational concepts needed to thoroughly understand decorators (functions as objects, scope, and closures), and give you a good introduction into how decorators are used and defined.

    "Managing Resources : In any programming language, the usage of resources like file operations or database connections is very common. But these resources are limited in supply. Therefore, the main problem lies in making sure to release these resources after usage. If they are not released then it will lead to resource leakage and may cause the system to either slow down or crash. It would be very helpful if user have a mechanism for the automatic setup and teardown of resources.In Python, it can be achieved by the usage of context managers which facilitate the proper handling of resources. The most common way of performing file operations is by using the with keyword as shown below:\n",

    "Using Inner vs Private Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you create helper inner functions like most_common_provider() when you want to provide encapsulation. You can also create inner functions if you think you’re not going to call them anywhere else apart from the containing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although writing your helper functions as inner functions achieves the desired result, you’ll probably be better served by extracting them as top-level functions. In this case, you could use a leading underscore (_) in the name of the function to indicate that it’s private to the current module or class. This will allow you to access your helper functions from anywhere else in the current module or class and reuse them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting inner functions into top-level private functions can make your code cleaner and more readable. This practice can produce functions that consequently apply the single-responsibility principle.\n"

You need to convince your boss that the decorator is adding too much processing time to your function. To do this, you are going to measure how long the decorated function takes to run and compare it to how long the undecorated function would have taken to run. This is the decorator in question:\n",
